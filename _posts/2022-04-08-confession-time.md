Last week, I received an email from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) reminding me to renew my certificates. I forgot to renew it and the certificate expired. Now I can't send or receive any emails. If you send me email in the last week and wonder why I didn't respond, this is the reason. 

Anyway, I thought it will be easy to fix. Just run `certbot` again and let him do the job, right? NOPE. It is not that easy. It is just giving me errors with some success messages. If I was not so clueless about what the heck I am doing, I could fix the error. But I don't know anything about how SSL works and it is a shame. 

I don't even know the subject enough to Google it. I feel like I am the only guy in the planet whose certificate is expired. Seriously, how tf I can't find a solution to a such common problem? There was a saying like, *"If you can't find something on the internet, there is a high chance that you are being stupid"*. It was not exactly like this but I can't find the original quote either. Argghh...

If you know the original quote, email me... No, do not email because it does not work. F%ck this thing. F*%k everything. I deserved this. Do not help. If I can't fix this by myself, I should not call myself computer engineer. I am out.
